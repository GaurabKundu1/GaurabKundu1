- # Hi, I’m Gaurab kundu  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="50px"> 
## About Me
Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Computing Enthusiast With passion for Data Science and Machine Learning and always eager to learn something new, Which has led me to like getting insights from Data and use the Data for much greater uses.
Currently I am pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering with specialization in Data Science at Brainware University Kolkata.
Along with this I have completed the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate offered by IBM and worked on and completed the Applied Data Science Capstone Project "Winning Space Race Using Data Science" , Where we can predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. If we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. I have also completed the Data Science Math Skills course offered by Duke University. I have a keen interest towards Microsoft Azure Services, and I'm planning of to seat for the Microsoft DP900, AZ900 and AI900 Certification Exams.
